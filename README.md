# Answer for the CSRF Question:

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is a form of attack in which an authenticated user is coerced into performing an action unwillingly by including hidden components in a web application that utilize the authenticated user's credentials to perform the action. This can be mitigated by having an extra *authorization*, utilizing framework built-in CSRf protection, or adding CSRF tokens to state requests.
